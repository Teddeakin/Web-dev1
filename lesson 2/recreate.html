                While <a href="/headings">headings </a> do a grand, perfectly valid, job in defining the start of a new section or sub-section in a document, there are a number of elements that can be exploited to establish a cleaner, clearer semantic structure.

            Sectioning involves a handful of tags that can be used to define specific parts of a page, such as 
            <b>
                articles, headers, footers, and navigation.
            </b>

                An 
                <a href="/article element">article </a>
                element can be used to mark up a 
                <b>
                    standalone section 
                </b>
                of content. This could be used just once, if you think of a blog post as an article, for example, or a number of times, if you imagine replicating a traditional newspaper page with numerous articles.

                <a href="/section element">An article </a>

                    general section 
                </b>
                and could be used to split up an article, or to represent chapters, for example.
