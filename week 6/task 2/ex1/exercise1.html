        <h1>This container is <code>600px</code> wide</h1>
        <p>The spacing along the outside of the container is <code>20px</code>.</p>
        <p>The margin in between each child of the container is <code>1rem</code>. (Except for the images, which do not
            have a gap between them)</p>

        </div>
        <p>Hint: Using CSS `pseudo-classes` it is possible to remove margins that are not in between elements. Can you
            deduce which ones you might use?</p>
